# Leetcode Solutions
This repository contains solutions to Leetcode problems in various languages. This repository started when I familiarised myself with the C Programming Language and was later extended with solutions in other languages. 
Please note that these solutions are in no form or way an attempt to be the best or optimal solution in time or memory space.
